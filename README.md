# vue-project

This is a project for school where we where supposed to try out a new framework. I chose Vue. 
You can access this project by opening the code in VSC and open with liveserver. 

To get started with your own Vue-project, add following tag in your head-tag or install with npm.
* <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.12/dist/vue.js"></script>
* install -g @vue/cli
* vue create nameOfFolder
* npm run serve
